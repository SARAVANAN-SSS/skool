Debouncing :

Typing slow - 200ms
typing fast - 30ms

Performence -

iphone pro max = 14 letters = 14 API Calls - lets say 1000 people - 14000 API Calls
with debouncing
iphone pro max = 14 letters = 4 API Calls - lets say 1000 people - 4000 API Calls

This is the performence improvment debouncing makes in the application.

**What is Debouncing:**

**The Time difference between 2 key stroke is greater than certain time(200ms) make an API Call. Or else dont make an API call. This way we can make less no of API Calls.
